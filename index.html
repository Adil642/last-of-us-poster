  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h1>Look For The Light</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve seen the world end quietly — not with fire or war, but with the slow
      silence of people forgetting how to care. I’ve watched cities rot,
      buildings swallowed by vines, and laughter fade like dust in the wind. But
      even in that ruin, I found something worth saving. It wasn’t the cure. It
      wasn’t the mission. It was her. A girl who talked to herself, who read bad
      jokes off torn pages, who was stubborn enough to believe in something
      better. She made the dead world feel alive again. And for that, I would
      carry every sin, every lie, every scar. Because love, in a world like this,
      isn’t a gift — it’s a rebellion.
